# ▶️ YT Notes Takeaways

Here are the detailed notes for **Day 1** of the Kaggle Generative AI Intensive Course. The notes are structured using proper markdown with examples for clarity.

# **Day 1: Kaggle Generative AI Intensive Course**

## **Overview**

* This is a **5-day virtual course** aimed at teaching generative AI concepts and practical applications.
* Day 1 focuses on:
  * **Foundational Models**
  * **Prompt Engineering**
* Key components:
  * **Guest Speakers** discussing cutting-edge generative AI topics.
  * **Daily Assignments** using white papers and podcasts.
  * **Code Labs and Demos** to learn hands-on skills.
  * **Q&A Sessions** to resolve participant queries.
  * **Pop Quiz** to test knowledge.

---

## **Key Topics for Day 1**

### **1. Foundational Models**

#### What are Foundational Models?

* These are large, pre-trained models that serve as a base for various applications.
* Examples:
  * **Language Models (LLMs)** like GPT, Gemini, and others.
  * Multimodal models (handling text, image, audio, and video).
* Applications include:
  * **Machine Translation**
  * **Question-Answering**
  * **Text Summarization**
  * **Embedding Generation**

#### Training and Tuning

1. **Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT):**
   * Using high-quality labeled data for task-specific training.
   * Example: Training a chatbot to answer customer support queries.
2. **Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF):**
   * Aligning models with human preferences.
   * Example:
     * Users provide feedback via thumbs up/down.
     * This feedback is used to train a **Reward Model** to improve responses.
3. **Inference Optimization Techniques:**
   * **Quantization** : Reducing model precision to speed up inference.
   * **Distillation** : Training smaller models using outputs of larger models.
   * **Speculative Decoding** : Accelerating token generation during inference.

### **2. Prompt Engineering**

#### What is Prompt Engineering?

* The art of designing input prompts to guide model outputs effectively.

#### Types of Prompting

1. **Zero-Shot Prompting:**
   * No examples provided; just an instruction.
   * Example:
     ```plaintext
     Prompt: Classify the sentiment of this review: "I loved the product!"
     Output: Positive
     ```
2. **Few-Shot Prompting:**
   * Providing examples to guide the model.
   * Example:
     ```plaintext
     Prompt:
     Review: "The movie was fantastic!" -> Sentiment: Positive
     Review: "The food was terrible." -> Sentiment: Negative
     Review: "I had a great time." -> Sentiment:
     Output: Positive
     ```
3. **Chain of Thought Prompting:**
   * Asking the model to think step-by-step for better reasoning.
   * Example:
     ```plaintext
     Prompt: When I was 4 years old, my sister was twice my age. Now I’m 20. How old is my sister?
     Output:
     Step 1: When I was 4, my sister was 8 (twice my age).
     Step 2: The age difference is 4 years.
     Step 3: Now that I’m 20, my sister is 24.
     Answer: 24
     ```
4. **Structured Output Prompting (e.g., JSON mode):**
   * Ensures outputs are in a specific format.
   * Example:
     ```plaintext
     Prompt: Provide a summary of the book in JSON format.
     Output:
     {
       "title": "The Great Gatsby",
       "author": "F. Scott Fitzgerald",
       "summary": "A tragic story of love, wealth, and societal expectations."
     }
     ```

#### Parameters to Tune Outputs

* **Temperature** :
* Controls randomness in token selection.
* Example:
  * Low temperature: Predictable outputs.
  * High temperature: Diverse and creative outputs.
* **Top-K and Top-P Sampling** :
* Filters the token pool during generation.
* Top-K: Selects top K most probable tokens.
* Top-P: Selects tokens based on cumulative probability.

## **Day 1 Activities**

### **A. Code Labs**

* Participants work on **Colab Notebooks** to learn:

  1. **Single-Turn Prompting** :

  * Sending a single query and receiving a response.
  * Example:
    ```plaintext
    Prompt: Explain AI to me like I’m 5 years old.
    Output: AI is like a robot brain that helps computers solve problems and learn new things.
    ```

  1. **Conversational Applications** :

  * Creating chat interfaces that retain memory.
  * Example:
    ```plaintext
    Prompt 1: My name is Alex.
    Output 1: Nice to meet you, Alex!
    Prompt 2: What's my name?
    Output 2: Your name is Alex.
    ```

  1. **Working with Multiple Models** :

  * Comparing small and large models, such as Gemini 1.5 Flash.

  1. **Using Parameters** :

  * Modifying output length, temperature, and sampling methods.

  1. **Prompt Engineering Techniques** :

  * Chain of Thought prompting for complex tasks.

### **B. Q&A Highlights**

1. **Grounding with Google Search:**
   * Integrating search results to make model answers more reliable.
2. **OpenAI Compatibility:**
   * Gemini models are now compatible with OpenAI APIs with minimal code changes.
3. **Multimodal Outputs:**
   * Combining text, video, and images for rich, interactive outputs.
